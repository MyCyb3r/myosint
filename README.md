#  About:

Myosint was created to simplify the work of those who frequently use the Maigret, Sherlock, and Mr. Holmes tools. Installing these tools often requires creating virtual environments, which can be confusing for some users.

Additionally, for each tool, it is necessary to activate the application's virtual environment, use the application, deactivate the virtual environment, and repeat the process for each one.

Myosint automatically creates virtual environments for each application during installation and automates the usage process, just type the myosint command in the terminal.
    
For Debian based system. The Arch Linux version will be available soon.

  
#  Installation:

  ```console
  # clone myosint repo into folder ~/myosint and cd into ~/myosint

  chmod +x install.sh
